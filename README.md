2. Design choices :
The aim of this game is to relax the child and to make him focus on something else than his painful operation.
 - I have chosen a game that takes place in the mountains, to make the child think of another atmosphere than the medical infrastructures.
 - The child controls a snowball that goes down a mountain, which is relaxing to watch that may bring him back good memories.
 - The game is conceived not to be stressful, with no time delay, no fast moves.
 - The map is generated randomly for every game, so the game can be played several times before by the child without being bored.
   He can also challenge and beat his own score from a game to another.
